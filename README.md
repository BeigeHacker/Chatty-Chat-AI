# Chatty-Chat AI

An application for a agnostic chatbot that will answer simple small talk and a current in development feature is to include getting drink recommendations

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Knowledge of NodeJS
Knowledge of NLU/NLP

To be installed before running
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) - Node package manager
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - The runtime environment

You will also need to create a secrets.json file in the root folder so that the application can authorise to the NLU providers. A sample of what this looks like can be found [here]()

Install Node modules
```
npm install
```

If the above step completes without any issues you can start the project using the following
